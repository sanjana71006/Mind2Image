🖼️ Mind2Image – Text-to-Image AI Loop
Mind2Image is an AI-powered art generator that merges text generation and image synthesis into a seamless pipeline. It uses Hugging Face Transformers to generate imaginative scene descriptions and Stable Diffusion (via diffusers) to visualize them as realistic images.

✨ Key Features
Text-to-Image Automation: Prompts are generated with a language model, then visualized using Stable Diffusion.
Creative Prompt Loop: Runs in a loop to continuously generate imaginative visuals from a curated list of abstract, surreal, or whimsical scenarios.
Real-Time Visualization: Uses matplotlib to display the generated images live.
CUDA Support: Optimized for GPU acceleration for fast image rendering.

🧠 Tech Stack
Transformers (text generation pipeline)
Diffusers (Stable Diffusion for image generation)
Matplotlib (image display)
PyTorch (for backend deep learning)
CUDA (GPU acceleration)

🎯 Example Scenes
“A lonely girl sitting under a streetlamp in the rain”
“A peaceful village floating in the sky”
“An astronaut drinking coffee on the moon”
